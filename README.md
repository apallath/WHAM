## Details

### Binless formulation/MBAR (`WHAM.binless`) [more accurate]
- Implemented using log-likelihood maximization for superlinear convergence and self-consistent iteration (as a baseline/for debugging)
- Support for both 1D and multidimensional umbrella sampling.
- Support for reweighting 1D profiles to 2D (in a second related order parameter).

### Binned formulation (`WHAM.binned`) [faster]
- Implemented using log-likelihood maximization for superlinear convergence and self-consistent iteration (as a baseline/for debugging)
- Support for both 1D and multidimensional^ umbrella sampling.

^-> in progress

Both log-likelihood maximization approaches can use multiple nonlinear optimization algorithms. Read the documentation to see which algorithms are available.
