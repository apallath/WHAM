Usage
**************************

Binless WHAM is generally a better choice for accuracy, and implements
more features than binned WHAM (such as reweighting, binning 2D profiles
given a related order parameter, and integrating these profiles to obtain
free energy profiles in terms of a related unbiased order parameter).
However, binned WHAM is faster and uses less memory than
binless WHAM.

Log-likelihood maximization is a better approach than self-consistent iteration, which can suffer
from slow convergence.

Choose between the two different WHAM formulations and solution
approaches based on your needs.

Look at the documentation of the statistics module to understand how to
use statistical checks to verify the consistency of WHAM
calculations.

For examples demonstrating free energy profile calculations, see the `examples` directory.
